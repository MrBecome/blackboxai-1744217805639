# Shop Prices Calculator

## Project Overview
The Shop Prices Calculator is a simple C program that calculates the total cost of items in a shop and determines the maximum price among them. It also categorizes the purchase as a "Bulk Purchase" or "Normal Purchase" based on the total cost.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. You can use GCC for Linux and macOS, or MinGW for Windows. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. **Install GCC compiler:**
   - On **Ubuntu/Linux**: 
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install build-essential
     ```
   - On **macOS**:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```
   - On **Windows**: Download and install MinGW from [MinGW's official website](http://www.mingw.org/).

2. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

## Usage
To compile and run the Shop Prices Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `shop_prices.c`.
2. Compile the program using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc -o shop_prices shop_prices.c
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./shop_prices
   ```

Upon execution, the program will display the total cost of all items, the maximum price, and the type of purchase (Bulk or Normal).

## Features

- Identifies the maximum price among the listed items.
- Categorizes the transactions into "Bulk Purchase" or "Normal Purchase" based on the total cost.
